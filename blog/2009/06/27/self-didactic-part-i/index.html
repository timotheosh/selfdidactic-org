  <h1>Self Didactic Part I</h1>
  <p>
"You need to go to college. You'll never amount to anything without a college
education." I cannot tell you how many times I heard these words growing up. Far
too often, that is for sure. When I was in high school, I had no interest in
college. Heck, I could not even pass the courses in school that did not strike
my interest. When it came to being challenged by the course verses just skipping
the course work, it was bye bye course work. I barely squeaked by in high
school. Needless to say, I was not offered any scholarships to attend
college. My parents had not saved a college fund for me, and neither one of my
parents graduated from college. So why did they think I needed college anyways?
</p>

<p>
I think I understand now. My father got a good job with National Cash Register
(NCR) without a college degree for two reasons. One, he had served in the US
Army, and two, he managed to hold a couple other computer related jobs back in
the early sixties. NCR funded my dad's education. They sent him to school all
over the United States, at times two to three weeks at a time. My dad often told
me that if he did quit his job and then tried to get back into NCR, they would
refuse him because he was not a college graduate. My, how times have changed.
</p>

<p>
Having worked in the IT industry for nearly fifteen years, now, I have come to
notice something. Companies today seldom care about your college education. Even
the big corporations that used to not even regard a college drop out back in the
70's and 80's will make exceptions to their own rules. I have never graduated
from college, and yet, have been offered employment at IBM and worked at
Rockwell for almost two years. Both having made exceptions to my education in
attempting to bring me on. The big corporations have come to know the
truth. Experience is far more important than education. Four years of college
will often get you a decent paying job before you get that experience. But two
years of raw experience, in either going into business for yourself, or landing
a position with a startup company that gives you the opportunity to "do the
work" you are striving for, will get you the better paycheck much faster.
</p>

<p>
The reason is simple. Any bozo, can make it through college. But someone who
shows self initiative outside a structured environment show themselves to be
more resilient than the cookie cutter citizen graduating from college.
</p>

<p>
But enough college bashing from me. There are other, more noble reasons for
going to college, than to get a job. I think I would still be very nervous going
to a lawyer or worse yet, a doctor, who had not graduated from college.
</p>

<p>
Some people really believe they need that structured environment in order to
learn something. To those people, I would urge them that this belief is
misplaced. Anyone would learn better on their own, if they only learned to
master themselves. This is easy to do, yet it is also extremely difficult. It is
easy to do, because the steps in getting there are extremely simple. It is
extremely difficult, because you have to, that is, you MUST want self
discipline. If you do not hunger for it, in the sense of a deep yearning, it is
not very likely you will achieve it. Since "wanting" to be self disciplined is
such a difficult thing to convince ourselves of, we are not very likely to take
the small easy steps to get there.
</p>

<p>
Now, I must confess, that I am not the most disciplined individual in the
world. Not even close. I am 80 - 100 lbs overweight (I am working on losing
that), I have just started the daunting task of being self employed (sudden
unemployment has pushed me here) and I struggle on a daily basis to do the
things I really need to do to get my business where it needs to go. Old habits
are very difficult to break.
</p>

<p>
I have, however, come to acknowledge that in order to change these things in my
life, I have to change the way I think about things.
